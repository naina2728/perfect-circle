# Perfect Circle Game

A web-based game where players draw circles and get scored on how close they are to a perfect circle. Inspired by [neal.fun/perfect-circle](https://neal.fun/perfect-circle).

## üéØ Features

- **Interactive Drawing**: Draw circles using mouse or touch input
- **Real-time Scoring**: Get instant feedback on how circular your shape is
- **Visual Comparison**: See your drawn shape compared to a perfect circle
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Smooth Animations**: Beautiful UI transitions and score animations
- **Celebration Effects**: Special animations for high scores (90%+)

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Start Drawing**: Click and drag (or touch and drag on mobile) to start drawing
2. **Draw a Circle**: Try to draw as close to a perfect circle as possible
3. **Release to Score**: Let go of the mouse/touch to see your score
4. **Try Again**: Click "Try Again" to start over

## üèÜ Scoring System

The game uses advanced geometric algorithms to calculate how circular your shape is:

- **Radius Consistency**: Measures how uniform the distance from center to edge is
- **Perimeter Analysis**: Compares your shape's perimeter to a perfect circle
- **Shape Completeness**: Evaluates how well the shape closes

Score ranges:
- **95%+**: Perfect! Amazing circle!
- **85-94%**: Great job!
- **70-84%**: Not bad!
- **50-69%**: Keep practicing!
- **<50%**: More practice needed!
